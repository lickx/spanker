
- Rez rigged mesh, name it 'mesh'. Rigged attachments can't receive clicks.
- Apply the texture to the mesh

- Rez a tiny cube as rootprim, name it 'My spanker' or anything you like
- Apply the default transparent texture to the cube
- Position the cube inside the mesh, and link the mesh to it

- Rez two spheres, each 0.2 in x/y/z size, with transparent texture applied
- Name one sphere 'left', and the other 'right'
- Link the spheres to the linkset

- Copy animations. 'spank body' is a generic body animation.
  'spank left' and 'spank right' can animate/jiggle those sides.
- Copy sounds. Any sound with 'spank' in the name will be used on a hit.
  Any other sounds will automatically be used as moans.
- Copy the script

- Take the linkset in inventory, attach to pelvis (spanker) or chest (slapper).

- Position the 'left' and 'right' spheres more or less over the left bum/breast
  and right bum/breast (Edit linked)

- Test if everything works by clicking

If left vs right is opposite of what you expected, swap the numbers of
SIDE_LEFT and SIDE_RIGHT in the script; they are the material slots of 'mesh'

Optionally tune other constants in the script: NUM_STAGES, TIME_HEAL, NEAR_DIST,
MOAN_PROBABILITY.
